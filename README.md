# SingleOrigin

A Python module for atomic column position finding intended for structural analysis of high resolution scanning transmission electron microscope images of crystalline lattices. The module uses 2D Gaussian fitting and automatically accounts for intensity overlap between closely spaced columns based on image morphology.
