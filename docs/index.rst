Welcome to SingleOrigin's documentation!
========================================

**SingleOrigin** is a python package for fast and quantitative analysis of several modalities of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) data.

Supported modalities include: atomic resolution image analysis, 4D STEM, and EELS.

SingleOrigin uses several python Classes (with associated methods) for analysis of various types of data sets and storage of results.

Data and results are typically stored in numpy arrays or Pandas dataframes within the class objects, allowing ease of retrevial and manipulation by users for custom visulaizations or subsequent analysis.
